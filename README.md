# geocoding-property-price-register

Finding GPS co-ordinates for every house in the property price register (PPR) database in Ireland.

The property price register (PPR) in Ireland is a record of every house sale that takes place. A relatively poorly formatted address is provided for each house, but no GPS coordinates.

The aim of the code in this repository is to use Google to geocode the entire PPR dataset and tie each house to the correct electoral division and small area as defined by the CSO census boundaries.

Some visualisations are found in analysis.r
